## State Machines

### AgentStatus

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> idle : Agent created
    idle --> running : Sub-task execution begins
    running --> completed : Agent produces result
    running --> failed : Unrecoverable error
    completed --> [*]
    failed --> [*]
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `idle` | Agent has been created and registered but has not started executing its sub-task |
| `running` | Agent is actively processing its sub-task (LLM calls, tool invocations) |
| `completed` | Agent has successfully produced a result |
| `failed` | Agent encountered an error and could not complete its sub-task |

### WorkflowStatus

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> running : User submits task
    running --> completed : Synthesise node succeeds
    running --> failed : Any node raises unrecoverable error
    completed --> [*]
    failed --> [*]
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `running` | Workflow is actively being processed (decompose, assign, execute, or synthesise phase) |
| `completed` | All phases succeeded and a final result has been synthesised |
| `failed` | An error occurred in any phase that could not be recovered |

### SubTaskStatus

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> pending : Created by decompose
    pending --> assigned : Agent assigned by assign node
    assigned --> running : Agent begins execution
    running --> completed : Agent succeeds
    running --> failed : Agent fails
    completed --> [*]
    failed --> [*]
```

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `pending` | Sub-task has been created but no agent has been assigned yet |
| `assigned` | An agent has been assigned but execution has not started |
| `running` | The assigned agent is actively working on this sub-task |
| `completed` | The sub-task has been completed successfully |
| `failed` | The sub-task failed due to an agent error |

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Agent** | An autonomous AI entity configured with a specific LLM, tools, and system prompt to accomplish a sub-task. Agents are ephemeral (created per workflow run). |
| **Agent Registry** | In-memory store that tracks all active agents, their statuses, and parent-child relationships. |
| **Audit Event** | A persisted record of a significant system event (workflow start, agent creation, tool invocation, completion, failure). |
| **BYOK** | Bring Your Own Key. Users provide their own API keys for LLM and search providers. Keys are stored only in the browser. |
| **Communication Bus** | Internal message-passing mechanism between agents. All messages are persisted for auditability. |
| **Decompose** | The first phase of workflow execution where the supervisor LLM breaks a complex task into discrete sub-tasks. |
| **LangGraph** | A library from the LangChain ecosystem for building stateful, graph-based agent workflows. Used to implement the supervisor pattern. |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol. An open standard for connecting AI agents to external tool providers. Supports stdio and SSE transports. |
| **Skill** | A declarative configuration (`.skill.md` file) that defines an agent's specialisation: which model to use, which tools to allow, and what system prompt to inject. |
| **Sub-Task** | A discrete unit of work produced by task decomposition. Each sub-task is assigned to exactly one agent. |
| **Supervisor** | The top-level orchestration agent that decomposes tasks, assigns agents, monitors execution, and synthesises results. Implemented as a LangGraph StateGraph. |
| **Synthesise** | The final phase of workflow execution where the supervisor LLM combines all agent results into a unified answer. |
| **Tool** | A callable function available to agents. The system provides 5 built-in tools and can discover additional tools via MCP. |
| **Workflow** | A complete end-to-end execution: from user task submission through decomposition, agent execution, and synthesis to final result. |
| **Workspace** | A scoped directory on the server filesystem where `file_read` and `file_write` tools operate. Agents cannot access files outside this directory. |
